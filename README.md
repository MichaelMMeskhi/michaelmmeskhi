Bio: Ph.D. student at the University Of Houston working on <br>learning to learn problems such as meta-learning, <br>data distillation, knowledge representation, <br>and explainable AI.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Optimizing some non-linear binary programming code I wrote.
  - Working on analyzing information captured by meta-features.
  - Drafting 2 papers for JMLR and NeurIPS.
  - Spatial entropy in machine learning.
🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Learning more math.
  - Practicing good coding habits.
⚡ Hot take:
  - Jax is a better framework than PyTorch.
